Taking ideas and turning them into reality, solving complex problems, and learning and growing in the process
are what gets me out of bed in the morning.  Give me something to build, or a problem to be solved and I will find a solution.  I have an inherent love for logic and analysis, making me skilled at writing clean, well-commented, efficient code using the current best practices in Web and software development and allowing me to forge data into a powerful tool for enhanced decision making.  As a fast learner, who is teachable, I have an insatiable appetite for new knowledge.  I love to learn from those more experienced than I am, while at the same time enjoying helping others in their journey.  I am a hard worker and team player who is proficient in a variety of web tools and languages.
